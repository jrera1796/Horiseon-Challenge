HORISEON

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ways to optimize the website for search engines and screen readers as well as improving the codes readability. 

INDEX.HTML 

The code within this file has been rewritten to use descriptive elements to easily determine what it contains. 

Although we can use divs everywhere, like the source code, it is easier to use and also read these semantic elements (ie. article for our Article section) 

Alt tags have been added to the images on the website that describe what it is. For screen readers and hover o

These sections now contain comments that show what an element is and where it begins.  

STYLE.CSS

Some areas of this css file have been condensed and rewritten to remove unnecessary selectors and descriptors. Repeating descriptors were merged together.

Comments have also been added to make it easier to alter specific areas of the website.
